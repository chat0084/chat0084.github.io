      <h2>Hi, my name is Pigeon!</h2>
      <p>Birthday: April 4, 2018
      <br>
      Species: Cat
      <br>
      Colour: White
      <br>
      Eye colour: Green and blue </p>
      <p>I'm Pigeon and I was adopted by Grey in July 2020. I have a loud voice and I'm not afraid to use it! I love to meow at 3am when I'm hungry or bored. My favourite place to sleep is in the papasan or on my perch by the window. I love watching the birds, and squirrels, and bunny rabbits through the window. If only I could get my hands on them... I love salmon bisque for lunch, and Cheetos as a snack. Whenever sommeone opens a bag of Cheetos, I come running! I'll then stare at them until they let me lick the dust off their Cheeto.
        <br> <br>
      I love to sit on people's laps when they watch TV. But never pick me. I <em>hate</em> being picked up. And I <em>hate</em> going to the vet. It smells weird there and I don't trust those people in the scrubs! I love it when my best friend, Rollo, comes to visit. We'll play and run around the house at all hours of the night. I let him eat some of my tasty food since his is yucky! Sometimes he hides from me in the laundry room. I don't go in there... It's dark and scary. But Rollo is so brave!
